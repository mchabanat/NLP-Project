## Idea
In this NLP project, we want to design a sentiment classification system applied to customer reviews from the Amazon platform.
The main goal is to automatically predict the rating a user has given to a product, based solely on the title and textual content of the review.

To simplify the task and improve class balance, we have transformed this 5-class classification into a 3-class classification, which we will develop later.

Here you can find the research we did, the work on several machine learning models and the analysis of the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a well-known one, found on kaggle: ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews/data))
It can be downloaded directly from the following google drive, in the amazon_full_review_csv.tar.gz folder: ([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?resourcekey=0-TLwzfR2O-D2aPitmn5o9VQ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?resourcekey=0-TLwzfR2O-D2aPitmn5o9VQ)) 

## Use the project
To make the project work, you need to download the dataset, you'll probably have to adapt the path to the csv file, and then normally run the whole thing.
